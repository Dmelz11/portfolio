        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           He/Him: I am a life-long learner and live on the southern Oregon coast with my wife Laura. We have two sons
           Elijah and Daniel and have spent the last 20+ years living on a homestead we built in the 
           Cascade Siskiyou National Monument where we enjoyed living in the very rural and remote mountains of 
           southern Oregon. We spent much of our free time snowboarding and snowshoeing in the winter and paddleboarding,
           hiking and gardening in the summer. I've been growing various garden projects since the age of 5 yrs old and 
           our gardens at the "ranch" were extensive. We've scaled it back a bit but still grow most of our veggies.
        </p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          I have worked on and off, (mostly on) in the construction business as a self-employed general contractor, building
          and designing custom homes for most of my life with a few years spent in art where I did fine art for galleries in 
          Sedona Arizona and also worked as an illustrator, doing scholastic textbook illustrations and a childrens book.
          I'm still working in construction, but I'm currently pursuing an education in web development. I feel that the digital
          market place is showing by it's versability, accessibility and continued growth that this is the way forward and
        I'd very much like to be a part of that movement.

         <p> <!--Brief bio-->
           He/Him: I am a life-long learner and live on the southern Oregon coast with my wife Laura. We have two sons
           Elijah and Daniel and have spent the last 20+ years living on a homestead we built in the 
           Cascade Siskiyou National Monument where we enjoyed living in the very rural and remote mountains of 
           southern Oregon. We spent much of our free time snowboarding and snowshoeing in the winter and paddleboarding,
           hiking and gardening in the summer. I've been growing various garden projects since the age of 5 yrs old and 
           our gardens at the "ranch" were extensive. We've scaled it back a bit but still grow most of our veggies.
           I am currently working towards my next chapter which is learning web development. I'm enjoying
           this very much and hope to be able to work in the industry doing full stack development.
        </p>

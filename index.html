        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
           He/Him: I am a life-long learner and live on the southern Oregon coast with my wife Laura. We have two sons
           Elijah and Daniel and have spent the last 20+ years living on a homestead we built in the 
           Cascade Siskiyou National Monument where we enjoyed living in the very rural and remote mountains of 
           southern Oregon. We spent much of our free time snowboarding and snowshoeing in the winter and paddleboarding,
           hiking and gardening in the summer. I've been growing various garden projects since the age of 5 yrs old and 
           our gardens at the "ranch" were extensive. We've scaled it back a bit but still grow most of our veggies.

        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <p>
          I have worked on and off, (mostly on) in the construction business as a self-employed general contractor, building
          and designing custom homes for most of my life with a few years spent in art where I did fine art for galleries in 
          Sedona Arizona and also worked as an illustrator, doing scholastic textbook illustrations and a childrens book.
          I'm still working in construction, but I'm currently pursuing an education in web development. I feel that the digital
          market place is showing by it's versability, accessibility and continued growth that this is the way forward and
        I'd very much like to be a part of that movement.

        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>
          My resume in web developement is "in the works" as this portfolio is my very first project. I'm enjoying the learning 
          process very much and have found the community to be pretty supportive and generous as we all progress in the learning
          by doing, agile framework and very team oriented approach taught by our instructor and the edX bootcamp. I look forward 
          to working in the full-stack coding world and finding a practical way to participate in a team enviroment.
